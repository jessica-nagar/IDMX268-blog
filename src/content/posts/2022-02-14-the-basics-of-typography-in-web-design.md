# ***What is typography?***

            The appearance of text to the reader, or how the words appear on a page or screen, is determined by typography. By carefully choosing font, size, color, layout, alignment, and other aspects that affect the design of text on a page, typography aims to convey a deeper meaning. Letter design, kerning, and leading are examples of stylized elements. On top of ease-of-reading, digital text must be designed for, shorter attention spans, skim ability, accessibility, and multiple device types and screen sizes. Web typography also includes how we design the style of the text itself – fonts, colors, and styling – as well as how we show the text on its own web page.

# ***Why is it important?***

            You want your fonts to elicit good sentiments while also being easily readable. Your industry is the second aspect to consider when selecting typefaces. It will determine whether you use a lighthearted, informal font or a serious, professional one. If you're a professional IT company, you might want to go with a more current and professional typeface. If you're an online business aimed at teenagers, a casual, entertaining typeface would be ideal. Typography is important on any website since it ensures that we can read and comprehend all of the text-based material comfortably. The typefaces you choose are vital for supporting your brand's image, website readability, and text visual cues.

# ***How to use typography:***

### **Fonts and how to pair them**

There are two main classifications of fonts: serif and sans serif. Serif fonts have serifs which are extra embellishments at the end of strokes. Sans serif fonts do not have these extra embellishments. In most cases, one font is used for headers and the other for body material. It often helps to provide visual indications to what information the text offers and easy readability by adding a second typeface. If a third font is employed, it may be used in sub headers or as a CTA (call to action) button to visually alert the reader to the presence of a link to more information.

            Consider how typography is used on the web, from enormous headlines and bold blocks of text to smaller-sized text in body material, and you'll quickly understand that it's not only an important aspect of web design, but also a pure blend of art and science. Some things to think about when setting up the typography of your website are the contrast, color, readability and size of the text you choose to use. Sans serif fonts have been shown to be easier to read online in body copy because serifs make it more difficult for the eye to follow, whereas printed text is the opposite. Serif fonts are ideal for headlines and headings because they add a distinctive touch to a headline and are easy to read when dealing with smaller amounts of text. It's difficult to see text that's too small, while text that's too huge takes up too much room.

### **Using Web Safe Fonts**

            Using a web safe font will provide you more control over how your text appears across all browsers and operating systems. The most popular fonts that people like to use in web page design are: Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana, Georgia, and Courier. Some other approved fonts are: Impact, Lucida Console, Lucida Sans, Palatino, Tahoma, Comic Sans, and Trebuchet.

### **Proper Font Size is Crucial to Typography**

            Another important element of typography is font size. The three most popular units of measurements are: em, percentages, and pixels. Em is a popular typographic dimension for web designs because it scales well and allows for smaller size increments. Many people prefer to use percentages for font sizes because they provide the user more choice over the size of the font. The font size options in their browser decide the size. Pixels are a unit of measurement for screen resolution and provide you less control because you can only use full numbers. CSS can also be used to control kerning and leading. The letter-spacing attribute can be used to modify kerning, which is the gap between characters. The CSS property line-height can be used to manage leading.
